Is a string properly nested?
Introduction
A string S consisting of N characters is considered to be properly nested if
  any of the following conditions is true:
S is empty;
  S has the form “(U)” or “[U]” or “{U}” where U is a properly nested string;
  S has the form “VW” where V and W are properly nested strings.
For example, the string “{[()()]}” is properly nested but “([)()]” is not.
Task: write a function
int solution(char *S);
that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is properly
  nested and 0 otherwise.
Example
For example, given “{[()()]}”, the function should return 1 and given “([)()]”,
  the function should return 0, as explained above.
Assume that
N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
String S consists only of the following characters: “(“, “{“, “[“, “]”, “}” and/or “)”.
Expected Complexity
Expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
Expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required
  for input arguments).
